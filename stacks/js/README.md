# Stacks in JavaScript

[![js](https://github.com/claudemuller/data-structures/actions/workflows/stacks.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/claudemuller/data-structures/actions/workflows/stacks.js.yml)

The `Stack` class in this implementation is overkill as JavaScript's `Array` type already works like a stack, but this is for demo purposes in case extra logic would need to be added.

The [companion article](https://dxt.rs/category/programming/general/stacks) discussing stacks can be found here.
