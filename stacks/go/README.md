# Stacks in Go

[![go](https://github.com/claudemuller/data-structures/actions/workflows/stacks.go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/claudemuller/data-structures/actions/workflows/stacks.go.yml)

The `Stack` struct in this implementation is overkill as Go's List type already works like a stack, but this is for demo purposes in case extra logic would need to be added.

The [companion article](https://dxt.rs/category/programming/general/stacks) discussing stacks can be found here.
